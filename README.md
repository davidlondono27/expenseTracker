# expenseTracker
Project using SwiftUI, SwiftData, SwiftCharts, Widgets and Biometric Lock.

## Mis Gastosâ€™ App:

With "Mis gastos", you have total control of your finances at your fingertips. This application allows you to record all your income and expenses in detail, making money management easier. With its advanced search functions, you can easily and quickly locate specific transactions. In addition, you can review interactive charts that clearly and visually illustrate how your finances have behaved over time. To ensure the security of your information, "Mis gastos" uses FaceID or fingerprint unlock on your iPhone, which means that only you can access your financial data. Customize the application according to your needs and preferences, and for even faster and more convenient access, you can add the "Mis gastos" Widget to your home screen.

## System and Architecture

"Mis gastos" uses the sophisticated MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. This architecture is known for its robustness and efficiency in organizing code, which improves its maintainability and scalability. In addition, an interactive UI system has been incorporated thanks to the implementation of SwiftUI, an innovative technology that allows for efficient development of user interfaces.

Another notable aspect of "Mis gastos" is its use of AppStorage* for data storage. This means that all data is saved locally on the user's device, allowing it to be persistent and always accessible, which significantly enhances the user experience.

To further improve the usability and visual appeal of the application, various animations have been implemented in navigation, views, and the chart. These animations help make interaction with the application a more enjoyable and dynamic experience.

Charts, a key element for visualizing expenses, have been developed using the Swift Charts library. This library stands out for its ease of use and its ability to produce attractive and easily understandable charts.

Finally, to increase the application's functionality, WidgetKit has been used to create an app widget. This allows users to access important information directly from their device's home screen.

*The AppStorage functionality of SwiftData is only available from iOS 17 onwards. Therefore, users should make sure they have a compatible version of iOS to be able to enjoy all the advantages that "My Expenses" has to offer.

### Inspiring and Copyright

"Mis gastos" is an application inspired by the work done in the SwiftData series by *KavSoft*. This series was a source of inspiration and you can find more details about its development process on their [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/posts/swiftui-expense-94429849).

On the other hand, the incorporated elements of architecture and biometric blocking were inspired by the *Hacking with Swift* series, which is [available on Youtube](https://youtu.be/k1A0YTkMCxc?si=hSaFxdjU7JB8I0mf). This series offers a wealth of knowledge and valuable techniques for application developers.

Regarding the architecture of "Mis gastos", along with the constant system, the design changes, the new implementations, the project setup, the modifiers and other elements, all of these were our own developments. These developments were carried out considering the specific implementations of each of the resources mentioned above. This joint effort has allowed the creation of a functional and easy-to-use application.
